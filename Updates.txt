1) We initialized the project idea and discussed the overall structure of the software.
We added github issues to the github repository. We split into two teams:
one team will work on making the structure of the json file that will keep all 
information about the personal expenses. 
The other team will be working on the main menu of the software, which will take
inputs from the user for the budgets.

2) We plan to keep working on our teams to develop the main menu and the structure of the JSON file.

3) We have just started the development progress. We currently don't have any issues.
